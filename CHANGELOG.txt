   + Asset managers implemented
   + Logging implemented
   + Splash screen added
   + Replaced SDL_mixer with OpenAL
   + SDL_gfx dependency removed

Version 0.6.6 (6.27.2012):
   + Fullscreen mode by default in release build
   + Sound effects fixed
   + Split event system into generic and specific

   + Added shooting
   + Several memory leaks removed, segfault still occurs
   + Modified intro scene
   - Removed old menu songs
   + Added a new, spookier menu song

Version 0.6a (6.25.12):
   + Complete re-write of the code base, again.
   - No more enemies
   - No longer depends on SOIL library
   + Now depends on the SDL_gfx library (RGBA blitting)
   + Intro scene that explains the storyline
   + Intro music

Version 0.5a (6.15.12):
   - Removed font memory leak
   + All subsystems quit properly
   + More code maintenance
   +  implemented, no actual AI execution yet
   + Drawing of primitives added, currently applied (line)
   Note: I've been considering not using  for my AI,
   simply because actual path-finding detracts from the
   point of the enemies. I'm going to use a
   "line-of-sight" technique to "scan" an area, and
   if the player is spotted, then employ true AI
   techniques like swarming and other attack methods.

Version 0.4a (6.15.12):
   + Added a game background, fixed sprite transparency.
   + Added an Options sub-menu with a music toggle.
   + Started making enemies and AI; currently there's one,
     and it just stays in one place, panning with the map
     properly.
   + Code cleanliness improved a tad

Version 0.3a (6.13.12):
   + Added an app icon
   + Fixed menu music

Version 0.2a (6.12.12):
   + Many classes completely re-written
   + Uniform code style adopted (still WIP) (see Style.hpp)
   + Map scrolling implemented

Version 0.1a (5.24.12):
   + Initial release (not really, but that's when I
     started this changelog)
   + Functional menu ("Options" doesn't work)
   + ASCII level loading
   + One wall, one floor, two player sprites (animated)
   + Basic level editor done
   + Tank moves, rotates, shoots, etc.
