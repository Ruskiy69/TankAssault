* Current Version: 0.5 Alpha                                    *
* Last Updated   : 6.15.2012                                    *
*                                                               *
*   Version 0.5a (6.15.12):                                     *
*       - Removed font memory leak                              *
*       + All subsystems quit properly                          *
*       + More code maintenance                                 *
*       + A* implemented, no actual AI execution yet            *
*       + Drawing of primitives added, currently applied (line) *
*       Note: I've been considering not using A* for my AI,     *
*       simply because actual path-finding detracts from the    *
*       point of the enemies. I'm going to use a                *
*       "line-of-sight" technique to "scan" an area, and        *
*       if the player is spotted, then employ true AI           *
*       techniques like swarming and other attack methods.      *
*                                                               *
*   Version 0.4a (6.15.12):                                     *
*       + Added a game background, fixed sprite transparency.   *
*       + Added an Options sub-menu with a music toggle.        *
*       + Started making enemies and AI; currently there's one, *
*         and it just stays in one place, panning with the map  *
*         properly.                                             *
*       + Code cleanliness improved a tad                       *
*                                                               *
*   Version 0.3a (6.13.12):                                     *
*       + Added an app icon                                     *
*       + Fixed menu music                                      *
*                                                               *
*   Version 0.2a (6.12.12):                                     *
*       + Many classes completely re-written                    *
*       + Uniform code style adopted (still WIP) (see Style.h)  *
*       + Map scrolling implemented                             *
*                                                               *
*   Version 0.1a (5.24.12):                                     *
*       + Initial release (not really, but that's when I        *
*         started this changelog)                               *
*       + Functional menu ("Options" doesn't work)              *
*       + ASCII level loading                                   *
*       + One wall, one floor, two player sprites (animated)    *
*       + Basic level editor done                               *
*       + Tank moves, rotates, shoots, etc.                     *
*                                                               *
