Gameplay:
    The year is 2200. The earth is now a barren wastland after
    the Collapse. The robotic mechs created by mankind
    revolted, destroying all signs of life on Earth. Modern
    military equipment could do nothing to stop the AI overrun.
    Any and all humans were terminated with extreme prejudice.
    You play as Sgt. Maksimov, the last survivor of the
    Eurasian Guerilla Army. Take command of his tank and
    complete his final mission: free the Earth of the Mechs.
