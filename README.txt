*   You are the green tank. Cruise around from level to level   *
*   and eliminate all the enemies. Enemies come in many shapes  *
*   and appearances, from tanks to turrets to soldiers, be      *
*   alert! Grab power-ups and weapon upgrades to make your tank *
*   outperform everyone elses. Kill everything in sight.        *
*                                                               *
* About:                                                        *
*   Tank Assault is a simple game I made using OpenGL and SDL.  *
* OpenGL does all of the rendering, SDL does everything else.   *
* Nearly everything, including the engine, gameplay, and        *
* graphics is done by me. Fonts, icons, and sounds are courtesy *
* of the world wide web. Don't expect too much out of this      * 
* game, I'm sure there are dozens of problems I'm not even      *
* aware of...                                                   *
*                                                               *
* Level Editor:                                                 *
* I included a simple level editor in case you want to create   *
* your own for whatever reason. It is the same one I used in    *
* the game, albeit it might be slightly out-dated, because I    *
* focus more on updating the game, not the editor.              *
* Using it is simple, 'S' switches between tiles, left-click    *
* places them, 'E' exports everything on-screen to Map.txt, 'I' *
* imports everything from Map.txt.                              *
*                                                               *
* Special Thanks:                                               *
*   Don't tell, but I used Daft Punk's TRON Legacy soundtrack   *
*   in this game. Also, some random orchestal music I found     *
*   on YouTube. And a ton of sound effects from SoundBible.com. *
